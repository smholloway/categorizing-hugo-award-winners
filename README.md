# Categorizing Hugo Award winners

A friend suggested the [Hugo Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel#Winners_and_nominees) as a source for books to read. The Hugo Awards highlight the best sci-fi or fantasy novels of the year. Unfortunately, "sci-fi and fantasy" is extremely broad, including everything from vampires and werewolves to lasers and spaceships. I was frustrated that the Wikipedia page did not include the genre of book, so I wrote a simple program to report the Wikipedia-reported genre for each Hugo Award entry.
